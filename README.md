# tic-tac-toe
What's This?
  I've created this project for my assembly course this project is totally based on assembly 8086 and can be run on dosbox.
  In this program you can play tic tac toe with your friend as well as with computer.
  Logic is not perfect but efficient at the same time I didn't used any loops/stacks to keep this program upto mark.
  
Let me explain the logic so you dont have to read the code and comments are also available for true understanding.
What's Going on?
  1.In this code first I've declare the variabls with "?" which will work as indexes and some variables containing the messages to print. 
  2.By starting the program I'm going to take input so user can choose whether he wants to play with computer or friend.According to input the program will excecute.
pending.....

This repository is public so you can take inspiration/help from this code but I suggest you to do not copy the code but the logic.
